# TODO

## Test with real readings first
- [ ] Add a Gemini API key and run a few real readings (a text PDF, a scanned chapter, an equation-heavy paper)
- [ ] Check Gemini keeps the whole text and doesn't quietly summarise (the app warns when the script looks short)
- [ ] Check whether Gemini refuses pages of published papers ("RECITATION"); if it happens often, try smaller chunks or a different model

## Cleaning up the text
Handled by the Gemini instructions in `src/audiobook_ai/script.py`; tune them on real readings.
- [ ] Reference lists, page numbers, running headers and footers are skipped
- [ ] In-text citations removed or softened ("Fama and French (1993) show" → "Fama and French show")
- [ ] URLs, DOIs and footnote markers dropped; decide whether footnotes should be read
- [ ] Equations: read short ones in words ("beta equals the covariance of…"), and summarise long ones ("Equation 3 says expected excess returns rise with beta")
- [ ] Tables and regression output: never read cell by cell; give one or two sentences on the main finding plus "see Table 2"
- [ ] Notation: say β, α and σ properly, plus acronyms like CAPM, OLS and GARCH
- [ ] Pronunciation list for words the voice gets wrong (author names, jargon)
- [ ] Appendices are skipped with a one-line mention; make that a setting

## Player
- [ ] Original page beside the player, so you can see the real equation or table while taking notes
- [ ] Bookmark key: mark a sentence while listening, then export your marks with your notes

## Study aids
- [ ] Notes and highlights for the important sections: key arguments, definitions and findings marked in the player and exported as notes. Deciding what's important is the hard part; a first version could have Gemini mark key sentences when it writes the script
- [ ] A 60-second "here's the argument" intro before the reading starts
- [ ] A short recap at the end of each section
- [ ] 3–5 recall questions at the end

## Inputs and outputs
- [ ] Other inputs: EPUB, Word, web articles
- [ ] Private podcast feed for listening away from the desk
